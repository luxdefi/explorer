LUX Explorer provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. This includes the POA Network, Gnosis Chain, Ethereum Classic and other **Ethereum testnets, private networks and sidechains**.

See our [project documentation](https://docs.lux.com/) for detailed information and setup instructions.

For questions, comments and feature requests see the [discussions section](https://github.com/lux/lux/discussions) or via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/lux).

## About LUX Explorer

LUX Explorer is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains.

Explorer is an open-source alternative to centralized, closed source block explorers such as Etherscan, Etherchain and others.  As Ethereum sidechains and L2s continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate all transactions.

## Supported Projects

Explorer currently supports several hundred chains and rollups throughout the greater blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche, Near and many others include Explorer integrations. [A comprehensive list is available here](https://docs.lux.com/about/projects). If your project is not listed, please submit a PR or [contact the team in Discord](https://discord.com/invite/lux).
